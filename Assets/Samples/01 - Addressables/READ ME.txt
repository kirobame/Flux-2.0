Using the Addressables system has all of its benefits on the performance side of things. However, it also allows to think of
your design choices in an asynchronous way which results in always safer code. 

On top of that, the ability to not use direct referencing or the Asset references & pass directly by addresses to fetch data
is a great way to decouple the data from the logic of the code. With a strong naming convention, addresses do not have be
rewrote & there is no need any more to validate that scripts have their reference type data filled in.
