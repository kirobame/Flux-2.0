One of the concern handled by the E.D.S system is to allow to precise queries with flags without having to create empty structs like
in D.O.T.S. For this enums are used.

On top of that, the principle of Update groups & orders is also found to allow more tuning on different steps of the game logic

---[INDICATION]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
All data types can be found in Data.cs
All system types can be found in Systems.cs

Flags can be precised in the Inspector with the DynamicFlag type which allows to set an enum value for a specific enum type.
The Settings ScriptableObject specifies the distance traversed horizontally in one step.
