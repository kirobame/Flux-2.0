The Timetable class allows to create a work environment for any Lerp related behaviour through segments.
A segment represents the combination of a time range between 0-1 & an AnimationCurve. The Timetable applies a global duration on 
the local range of each segment. A segment with a range of 0-0.25 will only be called between 0 & 2.5seconds for a global time of 10seconds

The use of animation curves gives more flexibity for the final look of the effects.
